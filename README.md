I created an inverted circle collider, essentially making a circle shaped container that is able to hold entities in the scene, specifically circles and boxes(AABBs). 

Left mouse click spawns circle entities anywhere you click inside the container.
Right mouse click spawns box entities anywhere you click inside the container.

Random colors added to spawned entities for your visual pleasure.
